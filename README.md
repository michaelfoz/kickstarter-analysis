# Title: Module 1, Deliverable 3

# Kickstarting with Excel (Module 1)

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

### Purpose: In Module 1, we familiarize ourselves with the Excel program to assist a client, Louise, in her crowdfunding endeavors for plays.  We used the built-in functions and formulas in Excel (e.g., ROUND, IFERROR, VLOOKUP, MODE, AVERAGE, and more) to sort through the client’s “Kickstarter” worksheet. Doing this then allowed us to create visuals (e.g., charts and graphs) to provide the Louise with first-glance summaries of the data based on different conditions. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### I found that formatting the pivot table to look the same as the image provided was the most challenging; I had to do a lot of dragging and dropping and playing around with the rows/columns until I finally matched the imaged.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### I found challenging to type out the nested COUNTIF’s to filter/count the plays based on varying goal amounts, which ones were successful, failed or cancelled. At first, I was in a panic because my line graph did not match the image provided; I—at times-even got negative values for some of the criteria; I ultimately realized I had selected the wrong rows from the Kickstarter worksheet and had to carefully select and type in the correct rows in the worksheet that the COUNTIF function would reference.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The graph based on the data shows visually that the campaign does best during late Spring/early Summer in the months of May and June. The graph also shows that the campaign declines during the fall. Towards the end of the year during Winter months, the campaign does poorly. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- The graph shows that no plays were canceled.  Crowdfunding is successful over half the time if the goal is less than $20,000, or between $35,000-$40,000. As the goal increases, success rate steadily decreases until the goal is raised to $35,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- The crowdfunding only accounts for arts, entertainment and technology. The data only shows average donation amount, but does not tell us the MODE, or MEDIAN, amount(s) donated.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Some possible tables/graphs we could create might include: crowdfunding duration impact, effect of number of backers by launch country, comparison of success rates between different categories, variants of average donation amount between subcategories, or most successful launch season for each region by currency.
